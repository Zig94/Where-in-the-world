## General Information

- The application displays the results in the form of cards containing basic information about the country, such as name, region, population and capital.

- When you click on a country card, it is possible to get more detailed information.

- The application also allows you to move between countries by clicking on a button with the name of a neighboring country.

- The main goal of the World Explorer project is to consolidate the knowledge gained so far and to assimilate the basic concepts related to React technology and TypeScript language.

- This project provides an opportunity to explore the capabilities of these technologies and gain practical experience in their application.

The project has no specific requirements for Node.js and NPM versions, but I recommend using the latest stable versions to avoid compatibility issues.

## Project Status

Currently, the World Explorer project is in the development stage and is still undergoing improvements.

As I learn more , I will continue to work on this application, adding new information and function.

## Room for Improvement
