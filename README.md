## General Information

- The application displays the results in the form of cards containing basic information about the country, such as name, region, population and capital.

- When you click on a country card, it is possible to get more detailed information.

- The application also allows you to move between countries by clicking on a button with the name of a neighboring country.

- The main goal of the World Explorer project is to consolidate the knowledge gained so far and to assimilate the basic concepts related to React technology and TypeScript language.

- This project provides an opportunity to explore the capabilities of these technologies and gain practical experience in their application.
